# Day 16 — Array Average

Let's calculate averages! 📊

Write a function called `average` that takes an array of numbers and returns their average (mean).

**Example:**
```javascript
average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) → 3
average([10, 20, 30]) → 20
average([5, 15]) → 10
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and calculate `average([8, 12, 16, 20])`. The unlock code is this result.

**Hint:** Sum all numbers and divide by the array length!
