# Day 24 — Find Missing Number

Complete the sequence! 🎯

Write a function called `findMissing` that takes an array containing numbers from 1 to n (with one number missing) and returns the missing number.

**Example:**
```javascript
findMissing([1, 2, 4, 5]) → 3
findMissing([1, 3, 4, 5, 6]) → 2
findMissing([2, 3, 4, 5]) → 1
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and find the missing number in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The unlock code is this number.

**Hint:** The sum of 1 to n is n×(n+1)/2. Subtract the array sum from this!
