# Day 12 — Count Occurrences

Time to count! 🔢

Write a function called `countOccurrences` that takes a string and a character, and returns how many times that character appears.

**Example:**
```javascript
countOccurrences("hello", "l") → 2
countOccurrences("banana", "a") → 3
countOccurrences("code", "x") → 0
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and count "e" in "December". The unlock code is this number.

**Hint:** Loop through the string or use `.split()` and check the array length!
