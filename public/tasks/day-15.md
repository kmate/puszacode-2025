# Day 15 — FizzBuzz Single

A classic challenge! 🎮

Write a function called `fizzBuzz` that takes a number and returns:
- "Fizz" if divisible by 3
- "Buzz" if divisible by 5
- "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both
- The number as a string otherwise

**Example:**
```javascript
fizzBuzz(3) → "Fizz"
fizzBuzz(5) → "Buzz"
fizzBuzz(15) → "FizzBuzz"
fizzBuzz(7) → "7"
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and call `fizzBuzz(30)`. The unlock code is this result.

**Hint:** Check divisibility by 15 first!
