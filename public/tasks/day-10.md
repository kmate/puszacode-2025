# Second Maximum

Array exploration continues! 📈

Write a method called `findSecondMax` that takes an array of integers and returns the second largest number. If all numbers are the same, return that number.

**Example:**
```java
findSecondMax(new int[]{1, 5, 3, 9, 2}) → 5
findSecondMax(new int[]{10, 20, 15}) → 15
findSecondMax(new int[]{7, 7, 7}) → 7
```


**Your task:**
Create the method and find `findSecondMax(new int[]{34, 67, 23, 89, 12, 89})`. The unlock code is this number.

**Hint:** Find max first, then find the largest number that's smaller than max!
