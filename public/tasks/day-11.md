# Day 11 — Filter Even Numbers

Let's filter arrays! 🎯

Write a function called `filterEven` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with only the even numbers.

**Example:**
```javascript
filterEven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) → [2, 4]
filterEven([10, 15, 20]) → [10, 20]
filterEven([1, 3, 5]) → []
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and filter `[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`. The unlock code is the sum of the resulting even numbers.

**Hint:** Use the `.filter()` method!
