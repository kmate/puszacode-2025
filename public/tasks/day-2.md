# Day 2 — Prime-Even Fusion Calculator

Let's build a multi-step data cruncher! ✨

Write a method `complexCalculate(int[] nums)` that performs these operations in order:
1. Remove all negative numbers.
2. Collect all prime numbers(after removal) and compute their sum(S).
3. Collect all DISTINCT even numbers and compute their product(P). If there are no even numbers, P = 1.
4. Find the maximum number in the filtered list. Compute the sum of its decimal digits(D).
5. Return: (S * P) - D.
6. If fewer than 2 numbers remain after removing negatives, return -1.

Definitions:
- Prime: >1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.
- Distinct even numbers: each counted once regardless of duplicates.

**Examples:**
```java
complexCalculate(new int[]{7, 12, 5});
// S = 7 + 5 = 12
// Distinct evens = {12} → P = 12
// Max = 12 → D = 1 + 2 = 3
// Result = (12 * 12) - 3 = 144 - 3 = 141
complexCalculate(new int[]{2, 2, 3, 4});
// Filter: all non-negative already.
// Primes: 2, 2, 3 → S = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 (count duplicates normally)
// Distinct evens: {2, 4} → P = 2 * 4 = 8
// Max = 4 → D = 4
// Result = (7 * 8) - 4 = 56 - 4 = 52
complexCalculate(new int[]{-5, 11, 11, 8});
// Filter: {11, 11, 8}
// Primes: 11 + 11 = 22 → S = 22
// Distinct evens: {8} → P = 8
// Max = 11 → D = 1 + 1 = 2
// Result = (22 * 8) - 2 = 176 - 2 = 174
```

**Your task:**
Compute `complexCalculate(new int[]{7, 12, 12, 5, -3, 18, 21, 8})`. The unlock code is the computed result.

**Hint:** Helper methods: `isPrime(int n)`, use a `Set` for distinct evens, digit sum via loop or by converting to string.
