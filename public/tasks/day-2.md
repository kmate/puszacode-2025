# Day 2 — Sum It Up

Now let's work with numbers! ✨

Write a function called `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

**Example:**
```javascript
add(5, 3) → 8
add(10, 20) → 30
add(-5, 5) → 0
```

**Your task:**
Create the function and calculate `add(12, 13)`. The unlock code is this result as a number.

**Hint:** The `+` operator adds numbers together!
