# Word Counter

Let's explore strings! 📝

Write a method called `countWords` that takes a string and returns the number of words in it. Words are separated by spaces. Ignore leading/trailing spaces.

**Example:**
```java
countWords("hello world") → 2
countWords("  code  ") → 1
countWords("one two three four") → 4
countWords("") → 0
```


**Your task:**
Create the method and count words in "Merry Christmas Happy Coding". The unlock code is this number.

**Hint:** Use `trim()` and `split()`, then handle edge cases!
